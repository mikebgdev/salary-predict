## Description

In this project, I developed a machine learning model using Python and AI techniques to predict salaries based on various input features such as education level, years of experience, and job title. I processed and cleaned the dataset, then trained the model on historical salary data. Through iterative refinement and cross-validation, the model achieved significant accuracy in predicting salary ranges for new job postings or candidates. This project not only enhanced my understanding of machine learning algorithms but also provided practical insights into how AI can be applied to solve real-world problems such as salary prediction.
